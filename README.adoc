This document gathers documentation on software aspects related to the http://eurobench2020.eu/[Eurobench] project.

All material is automatically deployed to this https://eurobench.github.io/[github Website].

== Main content pointers

The principle documentation pages are the following:

* <<modules/ROOT/pages/model.adoc#Human model, Human model>>
* <<modules/ROOT/pages/data_format.adoc#Eurobench Data Format, Eurobench Data Format>>
* <<modules/ROOT/pages/template.adoc#Eurobench template, Eurobench protocol templates>>
* <<modules/ROOT/pages/pi_spec.adoc#Performance Indicator Specification, Performance Indicator Algorithm specification>>

== Modification Instructions

All the documentation is subject to evolution according to http://eurobench2020.eu/[Eurobench] needs.
If you identify errors, or want to provide additional material, please use traditional GitHub tools:

* Create an issue through the https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue[Git Hub Interface]
** please indicate the specific section you are referring to.
* Create an issue from the code file through the https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/opening-an-issue-from-code[Git Hub interface]
* Send an email to us (anthony.remazeilles@tecnalia.com Leader of WP6: Software Development).

== Content deployment

The repository is using https://antora.org/[Antora] to generate a static website from this content.
Antora requires 3 components:

* Components that contain the information to deploy.
  That is this repository.
  The structure of this repo is thus guided by Antora's requirements.
* A UI themes which configures the graphical aspect of the website.
  We use a fork of the default UI, located in the https://github.com/eurobench/antora_ui[Eurobench organization's github].
* A playbook that contains the configuration to be used by Antora to generate the static pages.
  The one we used in stored in the https://github.com/eurobench/antora_playbook[Eurobench organization's github].

General information on the Antora concepts can be found https://matthewsetter.com/antora/three-core-concepts/[here].

All the deployment is then handled through the link:.github/workflows/build_deploy.yml[GitHub actions] of this website.


== Additional Tools

To generate locally the documentation (under Linux), type from the repository root the command `make`.
It requires `make` and `asciidoctor` installed locally.

WARNING: Look for html pages in folder `modules/ROOT/pages`.
The link towards other pages may not be working locally.
